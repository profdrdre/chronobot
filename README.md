# The Chronobot Helper

## About 

This is an <strong>unofficial</strong> implementation for the solo-mode bot for the board game
    <a href="http://anachronyboardgame.com/">anachrony</a> published by
    <a href="https://mindclashgames.com/">Mindclash Games</a>. In the solo-mode an algorithm
    called the Chronobot takes the action of the competing player. The official rules can be found
    <a href="https://mindclashgames.com/chronobot/">here</a>. The Chronobot helper
    allows you to play the Chronobot without the need of setting up its board. It also does a lot of the bookkeeping.
